##  Description

**BTC** is a M5 base that allows you sit your M5 core instead of laying them down or hang on the wall. BTC is not just a sit for holding the M5 core but also comes with serveral features like temperature and humiluty detection(by SHT30), and charging base.

**Note:**

* Although M5Core [BASIC](https://docs.m5stack.com/#/en/core/basic) or [GRAY](https://docs.m5stack.com/#/en/core/gray) can be attached to this base, but BTC can not charge them. Actually, our Cores, as we know, are built in chargin chip (IP5306). After plugged a USB cable in, the Core was charging without any charger.

* Once M5Core has been attached to BTC, it can not controll ENV Unit at this time. Because BTC has been built in SHT30 sensor which will cause IIC address conflict.
