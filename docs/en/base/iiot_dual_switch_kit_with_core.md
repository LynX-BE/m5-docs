## Description

**IIoT Dual-Switch Kit with core** is a  functional-orientated module specifically built around BASE26.  Mainly implemented a dual-relay control. As is known that  BASE26 is created for industrial purpose, where may have plenty of relay-controlled application scenarios, add up the highly-customized features of BASE26, makes it a powerful and full-function node for IIoT. 
For example, you can stack an IoT module such as LoRa, GSM, LTE, etc, in between the M5 Core and BASE26 to make an IoT node with wireless control. 

## Product Features

- Two relays inside 
- Relay allows on/off current/voltage:
     - AC :10A @ 250V
     - DC :10A @ 24V
- DC power input: 9 ~ 24V
- Inherited all feature from BASE26 such as highly-customizable.
- 4 pin HT3.96 terminal connectors
- G15-Relay A/G12-Relay B

>1.EasyLoader is a simple and fast program burner. Every product page in EasyLoader provides a product-related case program. It can be burned to the master through simple steps, and a series of function verification can be performed.

>2.After downloading the software, double-click to run the application, connect the M5 device to the computer via the data cable, select the port parameters, and click **"Burn"** to start burning.

?>3.The CP210X (USB driver) needs to be installed before the EasyLoader is burned. [Click here to view the driver installation tutorial](en/related_documents/M5Burner#install-usb-driver)
