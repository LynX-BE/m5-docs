# UnitV2

## Description

UnitV2 is a high-efficiency AI recognition module launched by M5Stack, using Sigmstar SSD202D (integrated dual-core Cortex-A7 1.2Ghz processor) control core, integrated 256MB-DDR3 memory, 512MB NAND Flash, and 1080P camera. With embedded Linux operating system and rich software and hardware resources and development tools integrated, UnitV2 is committed to bringing users a simple and efficient AI development experience out of the box.

## Out Of The Box AI Recognition Function

- UnitV2 integrates not only the basic AI recognition service developed by M5Stack, but also has built-in multiple recognition functions (such as face recognition, object tracking and other common functions), which can quickly help users build AI recognition applications.
- All features! Plug and play! UnitV2 has a built-in wired network card. When you connect to a PC through the TypeC interface, it will automatically establish a network connection with UnitV2. With highly free connectable style, it can also be connected and debugged via WiFi.
- UART serial port output, all identification content is automatically output in `JSON` format through the serial port, which is convenient to call.

## Development Efficiency Improvement

- UnitV2's factory Linux image integrates a variety of basic peripherals and development tools (such as Jupter Notebook etc.)
- Through SSH access, you can fully control the hardware resources of this camera
- Easily build a custom recognition model through M5Stack's V-Training (AI model training service).

## Software Support

- The M5Stack team will update more identification function services through the release of firmware in the future, and users can directly update the software through TFCard.
