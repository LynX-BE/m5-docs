## Description

**YUN HAT** is a cloud-shaped multi-function environment information measurement base. Built-in temperature and humidity sensor **SHT20**, air pressure sensor **BMP280**, photoresistor,14 RGB LEDs. The board is build with Embedded Microprocesser ** STM32F030F4** , which implenmented a consice and efficient program APIs.
<br>
YUN HAT features a pretty appearance which could be used as a decration for your space.
<br>
The base is designed for the M5StickC, like other HAT devices, it is compatible with top socket of M5StickC. The overall structure adopts a three-layer design, and the upper and lower PCB boards serve as fixed structure and main circuit respectively, which is beneficial to the circuit conduct long hours of work.
<br>
the board also provides an independent external power interface.
<br>
The middle layer is a light-guided acrylic component. To achieve a better light display effect, The acrylic outer contour cutting surface is partially polished, and the purpose is to effectively reduce the scattering of light, making it evenly saturated with light effects.
<br>
One hook hole and two 6*4mm magnet mounting positions are reserved on the board, so users can easily magnet or hang in any corner of space.
