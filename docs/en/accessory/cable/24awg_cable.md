## Description

**24AWG 4-CORE Shielded Cable** is a STP(shielded twisted pair) cable that is commonly used for data communications. The aluminium foil and woven layer wrapping inside can effectively reduce signal interference and enhance the stability of communication lines. It is suitable for ordinary serial communication, and standard communication bus construction such as RS485, RS232, CAN, etc.
