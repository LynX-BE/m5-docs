## Firmware burning


>1.Double-click to open the Burner burning tool, select the corresponding device type in the left menu, select the firmware version you need, and click the download button to download.

<img src="assets\img\quick_start\core\burner_m5core01.webp" width="70%">

>2.Then connect the M5 device to the computer through the Type-C data cable, select the corresponding COM port, the baud rate can use the default configuration in M5Burner, i In addition, you can also fill in the device to be connected later during the firmware burning stage WIFI information. After configuration, click "Burn" to start burning.

>3.When the burning log prompts `Burn Successfully`, it means that the firmware has been burned.

<img src="assets\img\quick_start\core\burner_done.webp" width="70%">


?> When first burning or the firmware program runs abnormally, you can click "Erase" to erase the flash memory so that there is no need to erase again in the subsequent firmware update. Otherwise, the Wi-Fi information which is saved already will be deleted and the API Key will be refreshed.


## Configure WIFI

> UIFlow provides both offline and web version of the programmer. When using the web version, we need to configure a WiFi connection for the device. The following describes two ways to configure WiFi connection for the device (Burn configuration and AP hotspot configuration).

### Burn configuration WiFi(recommend)

?> UIFlow-1.4.5 and the above versions are in support of the pre-burning configuration under WIFI connnection. All users need to do is to fill in WIFI configuration box before setting your firmware to burn. After the configuration of WIFI, clicking 'Burn' to start firmware burning so that the WIFI infomation you filled in together with your firmware will be burned and stored into your M5 device.

<img src="assets\img\quick_start\core\burner_wifi.webp" width="70%">


### AP hotspot configuration WiFi

> 1. Click the red power button on the left side of the device to turn on the power. After the UIFlow Logo appears on the screen, quickly press the right button on the panel to enter the "Setup" page. Use the left and right buttons to switch up and down the menu options to the "Wi-Fi via AP" option, press the middle button to select, and enter the AP hotspot WiFi configuration mode.

<img src="assets\img\quick_start\core\core_ap_setup.webp">

> 2. After successfully connecting to the hotspot with your mobile phone, open the mobile phone browser to scan the QR code on the screen or directly access __192.168.4.1__, enter the page to fill in your personal WIFI information, and click Configure to record your WiFi information. The device will restart automatically after successful configuration and enter programming mode.

?> Note: Special characters such as "space" are not allowed in the configured WiFi information.

## Network Programming Mode and API KEY

#### Enter network programming mode

?> Network programming mode is a docking mode between M5 device and UIFlow web programming platform. The screen will show the current network connection status of the device. When the indicator is green, it means that you can receive program push at any time. Under default situation, after the first successful WiFi network configuration, the device will automatically restart and enter the network programming mode. If you do not know how to re-enter the programming mode after running other applications, you can refer to the following operations.

> After booting, quickly press the right button on the panel to enter the Setup page after the menu appears on the screen, select "Internet Mode", and use a computer browser to access [flow.m5stack.com](http://flow.m5stack.com/) Enter the UIFlow programming page.

<img src="assets\img\quick_start\core\core_wifi_mode.webp">


#### API KEY

> API KEY is the communication credential for M5 devices when using UIFlow web programming. By configuring the corresponding API KEY on UIFlow side, programs can be pushed for the specific devices. The user needs to visit [flow.m5stack.com](http://flow.m5stack.com/) in the computer web browser to enter the UIFlow programming page . Click the setting button in the menu bar at the upper right corner of the page, enter the API Key on the corresponding device, select the hardware for connecting, click OK to save and wait till it prompts successfully connecting
