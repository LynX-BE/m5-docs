    <div class="faq-answer">
      <div>
        <span> It may be that after stacking, the pins GPIO0 on the M5-Bus bus are not well connected to the M5Core. In this case, when downloading the program, GPIO0 should always remain low, but because the contact is not good, GPIO0 can not remain low all the time, so the download fails.
         Solution: Manually connect GPIO0 to GND during the download process to ensure that it is pulled low enough.</span>

      <div>
        <span> It may be that after stacking, the BATTERY pin on the lower left corner of the M5-Bus bus on the base is not well contacted with the M5Core, which is caused by the misalignment of the soldering position during production. After the bus pin welding position is slightly biased, it is prone to poor contact between the BATTERY pin and the M5Core. Solution: Re-solder the M5-Bus bus header, the pin header must be strictly aligned with the pad position.</span>

      <div><span> Causes and solutions: It may be because the supply current of these serial ports is not large enough. It is necessary to connect the capacitor between the RST pin and the GND pin in the main control (the capacitance value is larger than 0.1uF), or download When programming, connect GPIO 0 to GND so that GPIO 0 can continue low enough.</span>
