## Description

**M5SCALE DIY Kit** is a DIY kit of M5 that implements a digital scale, which makes it more of an Application-approach development kit. 

The overall structure is made of acrylic material. The electronic part is the main controller, M5StickC and a  WEIGH unit.  

A cantilever beam-sensor is used to detecting the bend over forced on top of the scale by object weight. 

it will transfer the deformation into a voltage signal and as an input of WEIGH sensor which will be captured and read by M5stickC.

Other than that, there also some small components that is included in the kit, you have the total freedom to assembly the whole thing and reprogram it as you like. 

The software is open-sourced on GitHub, you can program it either with UIflow or Arduino. 

The lego holes on bottom board allow you to place more M5 sensors for extension functions, Plus M5StickC is wifi available, you have the freedom to build something impressive.

>1.EasyLoader is a simple and fast program burner. Every product page in EasyLoader provides a product-related case program. It can be burned to the master through simple steps, and a series of function verification can be performed. .

>2. After downloading the software, double-click to run the application, connect the M5 device to the computer through the data cable, select the port parameters, click **"Burn"** to start burning. (**For M5StickC burning, please Set the baud rate to 750000 or 115200**)

?>3. Currently EasyLoader is only suitable for Windows operating system, compatible with M5 system adopts ESP32 as the control core host. Before installing for M5Core, you need to install CP210X driver (you do not need to install with M5StickC as controller)[Click here to view the driver installation tutorial](en/related_documents/M5Burner#install-usb-driver)
